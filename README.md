An ultrasonic sensor functions as an effective detector by emitting high-frequency sound waves and measuring the time it takes for the echo to return after reflecting off an object. This time interval is then used to calculate the distance between the sensor and the object. Ultrasonic sensors are highly versatile and can detect objects regardless of their material, color, or transparency, making them ideal for various applications such as obstacle detection in robotics, level sensing in tanks, and proximity detection in industrial automation. Their ability to operate in diverse environmental conditions, including dust, light, and humidity, further enhances their reliability and accuracy in different settings.
